A simple landing page to practice html and css with The Odin Project

## Learning goals
-Get more comfortable with html and css
-Get comfortable placing things on a page with flexbox

## Reflection
I had already done the basic html and css stuff with The Odin Project before the revamped it. 
It's now a lot better part of the course. I was coming back to web dev stuff after a break and wanted to get back into the workflow.
I definitely understand flexbox and placing things on a webpage more than when I first did the old project they had.
I still have some room to grow because I don't think my css organization is top notch and probably bodged the code in a few places, but I'm pretty proud of the results this time around. This should help a lot with making decent looking websites once I'm back on the ruby on rails curriculum.
